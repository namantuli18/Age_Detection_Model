## About Practice Problem: Age Detection of Indian Actors
Facial feature analysis has always been a topic of interest mainly due to its applicability. Deep Learning techniques are now making it possible for face analysis to be not just a dream but a reality. This practice problem is get you more acquainted with deep learning. As usual, we will not only provide you with the challenge and a solution checker, but also a set of tutorials to get you off the ground!
